##Day-1-Background of Python
####Histort of Python
1. Christmas 1989: Guido von Rossum started writing a compiler for Python.
2. 1991.2: The first Python compiler/interpreter was born and ut was implemented in C(followed by the Jython and IronPython versions which implemented by Java and C# respectively.)
3. 1994.1: Python 1.0 officially launched.
4. 2000.10:  Python 2. 0 released and added full function on garbage collection.
5. 2008.12: : Python 3.0 published, which is not fully compatible with previous Python versions. Many of the new features of Python 3.x have since been ported to Python 2.6/2.7, as there are many companies currently using Python 2.x in projects and operations
6. The current version of Python 3.7x was released in 2018, and its version number wad divided into three segments, A,B,and C, where A represents a large version number. Generally when overall rewriting or changes that are not backwward compatible, add A. B means the function is updated or a new function appears. C means small changes(such as fixing a bug). If you are interested in the history of Python, refer to a blog called [<Python Brief History>((http://www.cnblogs.com/vamei/archive/2013/02/06/2892628.html))]

#### Advantages and disadvantages of Python

Python has many advantages, which can be summed up as follows:
1. Simple and clear. 
2. The learning curve is low and Python is much easier to master than many other languages.
3. Open source code with strong communities and biosphere.
4. Interpretive language with inherent platform portability. 
5. Supports both mainstream programming paradigms, object-oriented programming and functional programming. 
6. Extensibility and  embeddedness.
7. Well-regulated and readble. 

Python shortcomings mainly are:
1. Implementation is less effecient, so computing-intensive tasks can be written by C/C++.
2. Code cannot be encrypt,  but many of today's companies sell services rather than software, this problem that will be downplayed.
3. There are too many framworks to choose from while develping(there are more than 100 Web frameworke for example), and mistakes can be made where there is a choice.

#### Application areas of Python
Python had been widely used in cloud infrastructure, DevOps, Web crawler development, data mining, machine learning and so on. As a result, a series of positions have been created, such as Web back-end development, data interface development, automated maintenace, automatic testing, scientific computing and visualization, data analysis, quatitive trading, robot development, image recognition and processing, natural language processing....

#### The development environment
I'v already builed Python in Win environment, and then installed many legendary tools, including:
1. Anaconda: Anaconda is an open source Python distribution that includes more than 180 science packages and their dependencies, including conda, Python, and so on. 
2. Jupyter notebook : It supports interactive operation of projects in the browser window.
3. PyCharm


#### Day1 practices
1. import this 
   OK... Everything should start with a good habit...
   
	"
	
	Beautiful is better than ugly.
	
	Explicit is better than implicit.
	
	Simple is better than complex.
	
	Complex is better than complicated.
	
	Flat is better than nested.
	
	Sparse is better than dense.
	
	Readability counts.
	
	Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
	
	Although practicality beats purity.
	
	Errors should never pass silently.
	
	Unless explicitly silenced.
	
	In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
	
	There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
	
	Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
	
	Now is better than never.
	
	Although never is often better than *right* now.
	
	If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
	
	If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
	
	Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
